    <h1>EXPERIMENTAL PAGE - FIGURING OUT SESSION ID'S</h1>

<p>Apparently I can't run this unless it's on the server. Testing with local files = PHP doesn't function.</p>

<br>

This button will create a new session with a predetermined username, the number 75, and the time of creation.		
    <p><form action="page1.php" method="post">
    <input type="submit" value="Run page1.php">
    </form></p>

    <br>

This button will let you see your session's information.

    <p><form action="page2.php" method="post">
    <input type="submit" value="Run page2.php">
    </form></p>

<p>Session -> page 1 -> page 2 = shows info correctly
<br>
Session -> page 1 -> page 2 -> Session (don't use Back) -> Page 2 = shows previous session info
<br>
Re-open browser -> Session -> page 2 = never opened a new session. No username, no #75, and time defaults to the 31st December 1969 17:00:00.
